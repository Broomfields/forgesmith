# Forgesmith Mod

## Forgesmith Summary
Forgesmith is a Minecraft mod that brings a major overhaul to material/tool/weapon/armour smithing. Initially created to integrate the weapons and armour from the game 'Mordhau', Forgesmith has since surpassed that in scope and overall design with a greater focus on smithing to create advanced materials/tools/weapons/armour. Mod created by Enstroe.
